Raymond's
1. A young boy who wishes to spend more time with his parents and has a hard time communicating with them.

2. Parents and children have a hard time finding things to do together.

3. a) Parents think playing games is bad for their children.
   b) High schoolers enjoy the game, whereas Parent/Child do not which defeats the purpose of using an adventure
      game to bring them closer.
   c) User experience or interface might be different depending on the device used to play the game
   d) Some features might be possible due to a desktop's hardware and browser but not plausible on a mobile
      device's.
   e) Browser compatability issues.
